You will need to **FORK** this repository (repo) to your own account.  After you have forked it to your account, you will then need to **CLONE** that repo to your computer.  By doing this, you will be able to work through the challenges and push your code back to your own repo.  All instructions are within each file.  Below details the instructions for both challenges.

**3.1 Input & DOM Manipulation Challenge**

- Using the html and js files provided, write a webpage that asks the user for input on a store, a quantity, and a product.  
    
    - Save the user input in 3 separate variables. 
        - Once the user has input their information, your webpage should console.log a sentence using those 3 variables. Using dom manipulation, you should also display the user input to the screen. For example: 'I shopped at *Target* for *5* *apples*' may be output to the console & screen. 
        
    - Do not alter the HTML doc.

    - This does not need to be styled in any sort of fashion, but feel free to if you would like!

**3.2 Guessing Game Challenge**

Use the provided HTML

 What is needed for a guesing game?

 1.  A range for our user to guess between. This should be 1-10.
 2.  A randomized computer answer.
 3.  A user guess that will provide a prompt
 4.  A guess count for the user set to 3 (for loop variable declaration)
 5.  gameLost = false


 Logic
 1.  A way to validate the user guess
 2.  Check if the user guess === the computer answer and alert that he / she won
 3.  If the user guess is greater than the computer answer - nudge him or her to guess lower
 4.  If the user guess is lower than the computer answer - nudge him or her to guess higher
 5.  Handle the case when a user loses

 **You will need to explore documentation on parseInt(), prompt, alert, Math.floor(), and Math.random()**

? not required:  If you liked to style it, feel free to add a stylesheet to your HTML.
